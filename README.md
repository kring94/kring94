## About me

I'm an electronic engineer passionate about programming and technology. Currently, I am focused on programming for Android using Kotlin. Here on my GitHub, you can find projects that I have developed to learn and put my knowledge into practice. The majority of them are for Android using Kotlin, but you can also find projects developed with C++, Python, and for the web.
